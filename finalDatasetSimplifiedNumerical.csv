Our results have demonstrated that the T7SS has anti-bacterial activity in addition to anti-eukaryotic function.,0
EsaD interacts with two accessory proteins encoded at the T7SS gene cluster EsaG a neutralising antitoxin and EsaE a putative chaperone that is required for EsaD secretion. ,0
We have identified a secreted nuclease substrate of the T7SS EsaD which inhibits the growth of closely related strains (Fig 4). ,0
We are also interested in T7SS substrate proteins collaborating with Prof Matthias Trost (Newcastle University) to undertake proteomic identification of secreted effectors. ,1
(Fig 3 - Media Library),0
We collaborate with Prof Bill Hunter (School of Life Sciences University of Dundee) to examine the structure and function of the core components of the secretion machinery (Fig 3) and the mechanism of substrate recognition. ,1
The Type VII protein secretion pathway The Type VII secretion system (T7SS) is found primarily in Gram positive bacteria and we study it in the opportunistic human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. ,0
This has allowed us to generate a model for the resting state TatABC complex shown in Fig 2. (Fig 2 - Media Library),0
Recently we have used disulphide mapping and molecular modelling (with Dr Phillip Stansfeld) to identify the positions of TatA and TatB within the receptor complex in resting state in vivo and to assess how these change when a substrate is bound. ,1
We are interested in the organisation of the TatABC receptor complex and the rearrangements that occur upon signal peptide interaction and take a range of approaches including genetics and in vivo crosslinking analysis to probe these events. ,0
A schematic for the dynamic operation of the Tat pathway is given in Fig 1. (Fig 1 - Media Library) ,0
The key components of the E. coli Tat system are three small membrane proteins termed TatA TatB and TatC. ,0
The Tat system has a challenging task because it allows the passage of folded substrates of varying sizes while maintaining the impermeability of the membrane to ions. ,0
Much of our work on the Tat pathway is undertaken in collaboration with Professors Ben Berks and Susan Lea (University of Oxford) and Dr Phillip Stansfeld (University of Warwick). ,1
We are interested in the mechanism of substrate recognition and protein translocation by the Tat pathway in the model organism Escherichia coli. ,0
Substrates are targeted to the Tat machinery because they are synthesized with N-terminal signal peptides that contain a conserved and essential twin-arginine motif. ,0
It has the highly unusual feature of transporting fully folded proteins. ,0
The Tat protein export system is present in the cytoplasmic membranes of many bacteria and archaea and is also found in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of plants. ,0

These curious organisms are interesting for three very fundamental reasons. ,0
Finally we study cell wall deficient or “L-form” bacteria and have described the molecular basis for their growth and proliferation. ,0
The compounds we look for are made by actinomycetes a fascinating group of bacteria that make many of our current antibiotics and other drugs and have amazing biology and life cycles.,0
We also collaborate with Demuris Ltd an antibiotic discovery company in finding inhibitors of some of the essential cell processes we study which might be turned into novel antibiotics. ,0
This lab uses an array of biochemical genetic and microscopic methods to study these problems in a range of bacteria including important pathogens. ,0

Postgraduate Supervision ,0
This research has significantly advanced understandings of how stigma associated with being outwith sexual/gender norms can make accessing rights of citizenship difficult or even impossible in some circumstances.,0
This can result in post-trafficked women being unable to confer citizenship on their children either because they lack citizenship themselves or their children were born in trafficking situations (and lack a known father). ,0
Lacking family support makes it difficult for them to access citizenship and ensuing rights as citizenship is typically conferred after the age of 16 through a male relative usually a girl’s father or husband. ,0
The underpinning research shows that trafficked women are typically stigmatised (labelled as prostitutes and/or HIV ‘carriers’) and experience social rejection from their families and communities. ,0
It brought trafficked women’s voices into policy development and implementation in relation to human rights which is significant because post-trafficking issues intersect with access to citizenship. ,0
The research was carried out through an innovative collaborative partnership with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Shakti Samuha one of the first anti-trafficking NGO’s globally to be founded by post-trafficked women. ,0
Post-trafficking starts when these scenarios end and describes the processes and practices associated with leaving trafficking situations. ,0
Most work on trafficking addresses its causes and characteristics feeding into policy frameworks targeting the ‘rescue’ of those experiencing diverse trafficking situations. ,0
This study is the first to systematically analyse women’s post-trafficking experiences. ,0
The second project (funded 2009-2012) was an examination of gender inequalities and citizenship issues in Nepal for post- trafficked women on their return ‘home’ (www.posttraffickingnepal.co.uk). ,0
In particular this research showed the importance of understanding implementation processes and barriers for policy debates about the delivery of equality measures. ,0
Rurality political hostility lack of local authority interest and associated stigma are limiting factors.  ,0
A key research finding was that despite recent legislative and policy shifts extending rights to sexual and gender minority communities sexualities equalities work is unevenly spread and far from becoming normalised. ,0
This study highlighted the importance of implementation mechanisms in driving forward the equalities agenda for sexual and gender minorities and identified barriers and patterns of resistance to such work that affect implementation and access to citizenship. ,0
One of these (funded 2007-2010) was a study of recent sexualities equalities initiatives in the UK (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/selg/). ,0
This theoretical work underpinned two Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funded empirical studies in different global contexts concerned with the rights demands of different minority groups.,0
Specifically it establishes how citizenship is connected to sexuality as well as to gender race and class. ,0
My research on gender sexuality and citizenship has raised important questions about the way citizenship is understood.  ,0
Economic and Social Research (ESRC) Funded Projects ,0
The project addressed a number of interlinked themes including the relation between cultural and material aspects of recognition as well as the conceptualisation of sexual citizenship and the democratisation of intimate life.,0
A central concern is to understand how models of citizenship are constructed and deployed by marginalised groups as new democratic moments emerge. ,0
I recently published a book on Sexuality and Citizenship based on my  Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship (2013-16)  project entitled ‘Transforming Citizenship: Sexuality Gender and Citizenship Struggles'. ,0

Research Roles,0
Through our ESRC seminar series on Postcolonial economies we brought together a dispersed international and interdisciplinary group of scholars from Geography Economics Development Studies Anthropology History Cultural Studies and elsewhere to explore some of the challenges and possibilities of using postcolonial approaches to think about contemporary economies. ,0
I have also worked with colleagues (Alex Hughes Uma Kothari Nina Laurie Cheryl McEwan and Alison Stenning) to explore different ways of thinking about the economic. ,1
I am also interested in the capacity of Islamic finance - whether delivered through banks charities or other agencies- to support job creation and empowerment in low income areas.,0
Other work has explored the growth of Islamic financial markets and how their construction varies in different regional regulatory political and cultural contexts. ,0
The initial tranche of writing for this will focus on the regulatory power of finance in shaping small firm behaviour. ,0
The research is being disseminated to academic audiences policy makers in regional and national government small business support organisations consultant/lobbying bodies legal organisations and trade unions. ,0
This interdisciplinary research adopted a longitudinal multi-method framework to explore how small firms understand and respond to different forms of regulation in contrasting sectoral and geographic contexts. ,0
I have completed an ESRC funded project on the regulation of small firms (with Simon Down Institute for International Management Practice Anglia Ruskin University Paul Richter (Newcastle University Business School) and Monder Ram (Centre for Research on Ethnic Minority Entrepreneurship De Montfort University). ,1
The project funded through Queen Mary's centre for the Study of Migration is part of a larger programme of research and is exploring Somali practices of charitable giving community building and mutual support in the aftermath of recession. ,0

Recent and ongoing Work,0
The theoretical concerns that pull these strands together include theorising the status of finance in economic development geographical political economy and what are being called the 'new economic geographies'.,0
Finally I am interested in the changing nature and practices of economic geography as a sub-discipline. ,0
Some of this work undertaken with Nick Henry (Newcastle) and Cheryl McEwan (Durham) explored some of Birmingham’s transnational trading networks responsible for producing commodities such as Bhangra music and a wide range of Asian foods. ,1
A second related stream of work concerns the construction of diverse economies. ,0
First I am interested in geographies of money and finance. ,0
I am an economic geographer with interests in three broad areas of activity. ,0
Geographies of money and finance; regional economic development; postcolonial economies; diverse economies; economic geography as a sub-discipline.,0

This research builds upon our report for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation Job Creation for Inclusive Growth in Cities – see https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/job-creation-inclusive-growth-cities   ,0
This research aims to explore the emergence of ‘inclusive growth’ and ‘inclusive economies’ and their utilisation and adaptation and urban development and policy. ,0
4. 'Inclusive growth’ and ‘inclusive economies’ in cities ,0
Focusing on England as a public sector reform laboratory amidst austerity since 2010 it is examining how financialising is unevenly rewiring and rescaling the objectives incentives and accountabilities of local statecraft and relocating risks and uncertainties onto local government and the local state.,0
3. Financialisation and the local state Scrutinising accounts of risky and speculative activities this project on ‘Financialisation and Local Statecraft in England: Councillors at the Casino?’ is developing a new theory of local statecraft to explain the differentiated financialisation of local government and its implications for local financial sustainability development wellbeing and politics. ,0
The project is led by Peter Sunley (Southampton) and is funded by the ESRC http://www.manufacturing-regions.org.uk/,1
This project is examining the geographical organisational and economic dynamics of four key manufacturing industries: electrical computing and optical equipment; aerospace; pharmaceuticals; and motor vehicles. ,0
It examines whether and how ‘traditional’ industrial regions provide a conducive context for their growth and whether there are significant local regional and urban dimensions to the causes of advanced manufacturing development. ,0
Focusing on the advanced manufacturing industries seen as key to any industrial renewal this proposal seeks to explain the determinants and geographies of their differential economic performance. ,0
However despite its centrality to aspirations for national and regional economic renewal and rebalancing and the profound uncertainties surrounding manufacturing after the Brexit vote there has been a lack of recent research into the evolution of manufacturing across Britain. ,0
Strengthening manufacturing in the Midlands and North is integral to sectoral and spatial rebalancing. ,0
It is argued that rebuilding the country’s manufacturing base will not only help provide a more stable mode of economic growth but promote a more even geographical distribution of growth. ,0
2. Manufacturing renaissance in industrial regions and the potential of advanced manufacturing for sectoral and spatial rebalancing The deep recession from 2008 and the persistent sectoral and spatial imbalances in the recovery have provoked a political call for ‘rebalancing’ the economy. ,0
The project consortium includes partners in the United Kingdom (Newcastle University and University College London) France (Universities of Strasbourg and Montpellier) and Germany (Leibniz institute for Regional Geography Leipzig).,0
This project is led by Danny MacKinnon and funded by Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR; France) the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; Germany) the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC; UK) as part of the Open Research Area (ORA) for the Social Sciences scheme. ,1
Adapting a process-oriented context sensitive approach the research will give agency and voice to people in peripheral regions and support the development of regionally-tailored policy responses. ,0
In summary the project will move beyond the label of ‘left behind’ places to advance a more sophisticated cross-national understanding of the development pathways and prospects of peripheral regions. ,0
iv) To identify new policy responses that combine conventional and alternative perspectives addressing the limitations of prevailing city-centric approaches to regional inequality based upon agglomeration and positive spill-overs from larger cities. ,0
iii) To examine the livelihood activities and practices of residents in peripheral regions remedying the neglect of how ‘ordinary’ people deal with peripherality; ,0
ii) To assess the relationships between the demographic dynamics of peripheral regions and people’s socio-economic health and political outcomes covering both population mobility and immobility to redress the existing research bias towards interregional mobility; ,0
i) To understand the distinctive circumstances and development pathways of peripheral regions overcoming the tendency to subsume different kinds of places beneath the broad category of ‘left behind’; ,0
Adopting a cross-national comparative approach this aim translates into four objectives: ,0
The aim of the project is to develop a new understanding of socio-economic and demographic change in peripheral regions going beyond the problematic label of ‘left behind’ places through in-depth investigation of their predicaments and prospects. ,0
1. Beyond 'left behind places': understanding demographic and socio-economic change in peripheral regions in France Germany and the UK,0
Current Research ,0

This work was part of my involvement in the Spatial Economics Research Centre (SERC) funded by ESRC Department for Business Innovation and Skills (DBIS) and the Welsh Assembly Government (WAG). ,0
It has been undertaken in collaboration with David Marlow (Third Life Economics and CURDS) Anja McCarthy (CURDS) Peter O’Brien (CURDS) and John Tomaney (UCL). ,1
Future areas of work aim to focus on the austerity state and decentralisation and the impacts of Brexit. ,0
This research includes studies of the demise of the RDAs the emergence of the LEPs and the Combined Authorities and metro-mayors in England. ,0
This work specifically examines the governance of economic development in England and has recently explored the shift away from regions regionalisation and regionalism toward rebalancing decentralisation and localism under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition and now Conservative government in the UK. ,0
3. The governance of uneven developmentThis ongoing research focuses on the governance of uneven development. ,0
See: https://www.cityevolutions.org.uk/ ,0
The project is led by Ron Martin (Cambridge University) and is funded by the ESRC Urban Transformations programme. ,1
How the structural details of this shift have played out across Britain's cities and with what consequences for city growth patterns are key questions the research addressed. ,0
Most of the analysis focused on the past forty years since 1971 a period when nationally a major shift in the national economy has occurred from manufacturing to services. ,0
How far these divergent growth evolutions have been influenced by differences in structural transformation and reorientation was the basic focus of this research. ,0
This project is intended to help inform these concerns and debates by focusing on how far and in what ways over the medium to long term cities have differed in their ability to reorientate and transform their economic structures in response to or anticipation of changes in demand competition trade and technology and how those differences have then influenced the comparative growth paths of cities. ,0
'Powering up' northern cities to unlock their growth potential is seen as crucial to securing that political imperative. ,0
In the UK interest in the economic performance of cities takes on particular importance given the Government's concern spatially to rebalance the economy between the less prosperous North and the more prosperous South. ,0
National governments and international bodies have likewise recognised the key economic role that cities play and have correspondingly directed attention to cities as the foci of policy intervention and governance reform. ,0
Both geographers and economists point to the increasing concentration of economic activity and wealth creation in cities and their crucial importance as the loci of national prosperity. ,0
2. Economic evolution structural change and adaptation in British cities Over the past few years cities and city-regions have assumed growing prominence in discussions over economic growth and performance. ,0
See: http://research.ncl.ac.uk/ibuild/.    ,0
The book was based upon work funded through the inter-disciplinary research centre i-BUILD (Infrastructure BUsiness models valuation and Innovation for Local Delivery) involving the Universities of Birmingham and Leeds and funded by EPSRC and ESRC began in 2013. ,0
See https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/financialising-city-statecraft-and-infrastructure. ,0
As urban infrastructure fixes for the London global city-region risk undermining national ‘rebalancing’ efforts in the UK city statecraft in the rest of the country is having uneasily to combine speculation risk-taking and prospective venturing with co-ordination planning and regulation. ,0
It develops fresh thinking on financialisation and city statecraft to explain the socially and spatially uneven mixing of managerial entrepreneurial and financialised city governance in austerity and limited decentralisation across England. ,0
Financialising City Statecraft and Infrastructure addresses the struggles of national and local states to fund finance and govern urban infrastructure. ,0
We published a book – Financialising City Statecraft and Infrastructure (2019 Elgar) – written by Andy Pike Peter O’Brien Tom Strickland Graham Thrower and John Tomaney. ,1
1.Financialisation the local state and infrastructure ,0
Recent Work My recent work was focused on 3 areas of activity:,0
My research builds upon close policy and institutional engagement and has informed local regional and urban development governance and policy for international (e.g. European Commission United Nations International-Labour Organisation (UN-ILO) Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) national (e.g. Government Departments – Business Energy and Industrial Strategy; Housing Communities and Local Government National Audit Office devolved administrations Joseph Rowntree Foundation) regional (e.g. Local Enterprise Partnerships Regional Development Agencies trade unions voluntary organisations) and local (e.g. Local Authorities Development Agencies) institutions.   ,0
This theme has been explored recently in work on: economic evolution structural change and adaptation in British cities (ESRC); financialisation the local state and infrastructure (EPSRC and ESRC); manufacturing renaissance in industrial regions and local industrial policy (ESRC); and 'left behind places' and understanding demographic and socio-economic change in peripheral regions in France Germany and the UK (ESRC ORA).,0
Second this research focuses upon the intersections between local regional and urban development and Economic Geography. ,0
In particular this work seeks to question and broaden our understandings of ‘development’ beyond the economic to encompass the social and ecological in more sustainable and progressive ways and to begin more meaningfully to connect development locally and regionally in the global North and South. ,0
First this research is concerned with the concepts and theory of the meaning and governance of development regionally and locally in an international context. ,0
This core provides the basis for two main strands of work. ,0
My central research interest is the geographical political economy of local regional and urban development governance and policy.  ,0

I am happy to discuss potential PhD topics in the areas of disability kinship and care medical innovation and feminist social theory.  ,0
The majority of these past and current students are ESRC funded. ,0
I have successfully supervised 17 PhD students to the completion of their studies and currently supervise 5 PhD students. ,0
Postgraduate Supervision,0
A wide selection of my publications can be downloaded from Newcastle University's 'e-prints service'.,0
These two areas of work come together at various points particularly when exploring experiences of and ideas about kinship and care. ,0
An additional long term research activity involves writing on contemporary feminist social theory in particular in relation to identities materiality and critical theory. ,0
Clearly explorations of family and kinship are central to such explorations and I am increasingly pursuing an interest in both the fluidity of kinship relations which are not framed by biology and the significance of genetics in ascribing particular narratives of what family is based on biological ties.,0
In the process the work challenges existing perceptions within disability studies that children and their families are simple objects of medical inquiry alongside challenging perceptions in medical sociology that disability is interesting when it happens to previously ‘normal’ adult bodies. ,0
Through this research interest crucial insights are being generated on the importance of the relationships between these different worlds in the production of meaning. ,0
My current primary research interest can be briefly represented as: exploring how childhood disability or illness is framed from within the worlds of medicine community and family. ,0

Further research consists of understanding the biological underpinning of dementia with neuropathology and clinical research on dementia with Lewy Bodies but also research designs for complex conditions such as dementia and autism. ,0
Moving to Newcastle University in 2014 my research programme covers both the development of statistical methods (complex synthesis multi-state models and Bayesian models) and the use of techniques for estimates of public health importance (prevalence incidence understanding risk and protective effects and healthy life expectancy) across a range of outcomes from dementia cognition through to frailty. ,0
Over the years I have developed a programme of research around developing and using state of the art statistical methods to the issues of understanding ageing. ,0
Initially working in cancer research in 1997 I moved to the MRC Biostatistics Unit in Cambridge to work on the Cognitive Function and Ageing study (www.cfas.ac.uk) and am now deputy director and principal statistician on this suite of studies. ,0
A statistician by training I have been involved in the design implementation and analysis of epidemiological studies throughout my career.  ,0

In this way we aim to generate new comparative research on the dynamics of interest representation and seek to understand how organizational imperatives and national factors shape the development of interest group communities across Europe,0
Empirically we combine a comprehensive mapping of interest communities in eight countries with an web-survey assessing structural and strategic features of organizational development. ,0
To understand how organized interests operate in this fluid environment we apply theoretical insights from exchange and resource dependence theory. ,0
Alternatively multi-level governance could constrain political representation and strengthen existing tendencies towards the politics of the professional because expertise knowledge has become increasingly important. ,0
It might encourage the involvement of a larger and more diverse range of interests because the decentralization of power can be seen as making policy processes more open and creating more participatory opportunities. ,0
The division of political authority between various levels could have two effects. ,0
This project seeks to explain how the dynamics of multilevel governance affect the establishment maintenance and development of organized interests. ,0
Policymaking responsibilities in many European democracies are dispersed between political authorities at different levels of government. ,0
Interest organizations nowadays operate in a highly complex and fragmented political environment. ,0

"""It is on the basis of this refined understanding of the cultural dimension of the employability of young people that we assess previous policy measures aimed at mitigating youth unemployment in Europe and separate out the factors that make a difference with the ultimate goal to propose new or refined measures.Flemish Research Foundation (FWO): """"The organizational development of national interests groups in a European comparative perspective"""". """,0
In other words it aims to develop a better understanding of the cultural pathways to economic self-sufficiency and entrepreneurship of adolescent and young adults. ,0
CUPESSE goes beyond the state of research by analysing how norms values and social axioms and their formation and transmission within the cultural context of family organization affect both the hard or cognitive skills and the soft or non-cognitive skills of young people and how these skills affect their employability and their employment situation. ,0
The broad empirical scope of the project allows for identifying various strategies to overcome high levels of youth unemployment in Europe. ,0
It is based on numerous research activities that complement each other to deliver a very comprehensive assessment of the problem of unemployment among adolescent and young adults in Europe as well as existing policy measures in the field. ,0
The CUPESSE project brings together theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches from four academic disciplines (economics political science psychology and sociology).,0
The research assumption is that cross-country variation will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the causes and effects of the very high levels of unemployment among young people in Europe which should subsequently allow us to better assess the effects and effectiveness of labour market policies designed to mitigate this phenomenon. ,0
The CUPESSE project carries out a comparative analysis of both the demand and supply side of youth unemployment in eight EU Member States (Austria Czech Republic Denmark Germany Hungary Italy Spain and the United Kingdom) and two Associated Countries (Switzerland and Turkey). ,0

Among his other work over the past decade have been projects on the impacts of migration on regional population change migration in rural England population change and ageing in rural England migration and residential preferences migration between metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas the evidence base for tracking frequent movers and the skills profile of Scottish migration. ,0
Other projects have examined the role of migration in changing the socio-demographic profile of British cities (for Joseph Rowntree Foundation) patterns of migration and population change in English cities (for the State of the English Cities Report) demographic aspects of the viability and self-containment of geographical economies and the regional and local impacts of central and eastern European labour migration (these last two for the previous government’s New Horizons programme). ,0
His three main current projects are tracking the economic dynamism of Britain’s largest city regions through the latest recession (with Alan Townsend Durham University) testing the extent to which Pennine England is becoming a single functionally-integrated polycentric urban region (with Mike Coombes also in CURDS) and assessing the relevance of the ‘escalator region’ effect for England’s secondary agglomerations (with Mike Coombes and Ian Gordon London School of Economics for the ESRC Spatial Economics Research Centre SERC). ,1
He was elected Academician of Social Sciences in 2010 and Vice President of the British Society for Population Studies for 2011-2013. ,1

Already this work has identified  steroids with selective anti-inflammatory rather than dysmetabolic  properties and novel tissue-specific determinants of intracellular  steroid concentrations that have important therapeutic potential.               ,0
Walker's group have applied their unique tools and expertise to  explain alterations in steroid metabolism and action in clinical  settings from sepsis to heart failure and to dissect the  cardiometabolic consequences of manipulating additional components of  steroid signalling including 5a-reductases (in prostate disease) and  aromatase (in breast disease). ,1
They are now pursuing the therapeutic implication of  this result that corticosterone might be as effective as cortisol  (hydrocortisone) in steroid replacement therapy without inducing side  effects mediated in adipose tissue such as obesity. ,0
Walker's  group showed that ABCC1 is expressed in the absence of ABCB1 in adipose  tissue resulting in excretion of corticosterone but not cortisol from  adipose tissue. ,1
Another mechanism dictating tissue-specific responsiveness to  glucocorticoids is the local expression of ABC transporters. ,0
Supported by a Wellcome Trust  Seeding Drug Discovery award Walker and colleagues discovered novel  11b-HSD1 inhibitors developed these to clinical trials and in  commercial partnership are exemplifying their efficacy in metabolic  cardiovascular and also cognitive disease. ,1
These findings spawned intensive  efforts in the pharmaceutical industry to make 11b-HSD1 inhibitors (>200  new chemical entity patents filed). ,0
This offers the exciting prospect of 11b-HSD1 inhibitors enhancing  revascularisation following ischaemia. ,0
By deleting 11b-HSD1 new  vessel growth is enhanced eg following myocardial infarction in mice.  ,0
Recently with colleagues in the Centre for  Cardiovascular Science they showed that glucocorticoids generated  within the vessel wall inhibit angiogenesis. ,0
Walker also discovered 11b-HSD1 in vascular smooth muscle in  the early 1990s. ,1
His group developed  novel stable isotope tracers and other tools to investigate this system  comprehensively in vivo in humans and found that 11b-HSD1  expression is increased selectively within adipose tissue in obesity.  ,0
In a seminal 1995 paper  Walker showed that inhibition of 11b-HSD1 reduces cortisol generation  and enhances insulin sensitivity in human liver. ,1
The  Edinburgh group showed initially in liver that 11b-HSD1 in fact  regenerates active cortisol from cortisone. ,0
In the  mid-1990s the intracellular enzyme 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11b-HSD1)was  thought to inactivate cortisol and perhaps ‘protect’ liver adipose  tissue and blood vessels from excessive exposure to cortisol. ,0
He then established the CORtisol NETwork  (CORNET) consortium undertaking genome wide association metaanalysis in  a sample of >20000; this provided a genetic instrument with which  to establish the causal relationship of hypercortisolaemia with  cardiovascular disease; and identified novel biological determinants of  tissue-specific cortisol action which his group are now dissecting under  a Wellcome Trust Investigator award. One of the determinants of cortisol action identified by Walker and  colleagues has proven to be a tractable therapeutic target. ,1
In parallel pharmaco-epidemiological studies involving  >250000 participants Walker and colleagues also documented that  exposure to exogenous glucocorticoids increases the risk of  cardiovascular disease. ,1
With BHF support in epidemiological studies Walker and colleagues  showed that plasma cortisol levels are elevated in subjects with  metabolic syndrome in particular those born with low birth weight and  that hypercortisolaemia is an independent prospective cardiovascular  risk factor. ,1
Brian Walker’s  research using a wide range of translational tools (rodent models  detailed integrative physiology in humans and epidemiology) has  systematically documented that cortisol contributes to the association between multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease (‘metabolic syndrome’) in the population how glucocorticoids influence vascular lesions and their complicationsand that manipulation of cortisol action offers novel therapeutic approaches in type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. ,1
Excessive activity of glucocorticoids (eg  cortisol) causes Cushing's syndrome with hypertension obesity glucose  intolerance and accelerated cardiovascular disease. ,0

Fibrosis research in the NFRG is funded by an MRC MICA Programme Grant in collaboration with GSK and grants from Duchenne UK. ,0
Additional studies are determining epigenetic changes that occur in hepatocytes and liver myofibroblasts in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with the aim of identifying biomarkers of disease progression to cirrhosis and cancer. ,0
More recently we have partnered with Duchenne UK to find solutions to cardiac fibrosis. ,0
Our fibrosis research works across multiple tissues and disease types including liver lung kidney heart skin and joints. ,0
This work has recently identified the alarming IL-1alpha as an epithelial-derived stimulator of fibroblast expression of the monocyte chemokine CCL2 the latter a mediator of inflammation and fibrosis. ,0
My work on fibrosis is focussed on cross-talk between the stressed epithelium and neighbouring fibroblast/myofibroblast lineages. ,0
Our latest work suggests that p50:p50:HDAC1 complexes suppress inflammatory gene expression by promoting a repressed state of chromatin at promoters and this of particular importance at genes controlling neutrophil migration. ,0
Biochemical studies in the lab are determining the mechanisms by which p50 operates as an anti-inflammatory factor and our current hypothesis is that this function is a property of a transcription repressor complex comprising p50:p50 homodimers complexed with the histone deactylase HDAC1. ,0
Ongoing work funded by a CRUK programme grant is determining the mechanisms by which neutrophils promote liver cancer this work has informed an upcoming clinical trial in HCC patients using a combination of classic checkpoint immunotherapy with neutrophil manipulation. ,0
We have also discovered that p50 is an important tumour suppressor since mice lacking p50 develop spontaneous age-related liver cancer and this is predominantly driven by neutrophils. ,0
Through my investigations on the functions of the transcription factor p50 a subunit of NF-kB my group have shown that inflammation results in telomere damage and ageing.,0
My main research interests are the transcriptional control of inflammation epigenetic control of fibrosis and the role of age-related chronic inflammation in ageing and cancer. ,0

Understanding of the role of genetics in the improved survival of leukaemia patients is my ultimate aim. ,0
My current interests involve the application of next-generation sequencing to search for novel significant mutations in acute leukaemia. ,0
Using this in association with other procedures we have identified novel chromosomal abnormalities with potential as molecular targets for therapy. ,0
Within my group we provided early development of procedures for array-based comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) in acute leukaemia which now is widely used for the detection of chromosomal imbalances not only in leukaemia but a wide range of other cancers. ,0
This approach led to the discovery of novel chromosomal abnormalities for which modified treatment has significantly improved survival.,0
FISH is now used routinely in UK and has been adopted into trial protocols in Europe and internationally. ,0
I was responsible for the development of FISH for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities of prognostic significance in UK acute leukaemia clinical treatment trials. ,0
From studies on deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q) in acute leukaemia I was one of the early pioneers of chromosome mapping using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH),0
The demand for images from these investigations continues to this day.,0
In the 1980’s I pioneered studies on the scanning electron microscopy of metaphase chromosomes to provide increased resolution for detailed analysis at the structural level. ,0
I have a passion for the development of new technologies. ,0
Some of the most recent analyses from these data have identified new cytogenetic-based risk categories in childhood and adult acute leukaemia which have resulted in changes in clinical practice. ,0
This has now developed into a large-scale collection of cytogenetic and genetic data containing information on more than 28000 UK patients which is renowned to be one of the best leukaemia genetics research resources in the world. ,0
I was responsible for the initiation of a database for the cytogenetics of acute leukaemia in 1988 when the importance of chromosomal abnormalities in risk stratification for treatment was becoming evident. ,0
I have over 30 years’ experience in planning and leading research activities of national/international repute in the area of cytogenetics/genetics of haematological malignancies. ,0
The remit of my research is to improve outcome for patients with acute leukaemia through genetics in UK treatment trials by characterisation of existing and discovery of novel genetic changes. ,0

Two reviews that give an overview of our interests in eukaryotic evolution:,0
More recently we have become interested in how Microsporidia use transport proteins to steal resources from infected host cells. ,0
In these studies we have often used the tiny minimal mitochondria (mitosome) of Microsporidia - which we discovered - as a model system.  ,0
Our investigations are aimed at identifying the essential functions of mitochondria for eukaryotes.  ,0
We have a long term interest in the discovery and characterisation of reduced organelles (hydrogenosomes mitosomes) related to mitochondria.  ,0
Cell Biology,0
Our aim is to improve the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees relevant to understanding the early evolution of eukaryotes.,0
PhylogeneticsWe are developing better methods based upon likelihood and Bayesian approaches for phylogenetic analysis of molecular data. ,0
We also study the effects of reductive evolution on parasite genomes.,0
We use whole genome data to investigate the contrasting roles of vertical and horizontal inheritance including genes of endosymbiotic origins in shaping eukaryotic genomes. ,0
Our work has the following broad themes: Genomics,0
We also investigate how reductive evolution has affected the biology of obligate intracellular Microsporidia parasites that infect most animal groups including humans.  ,0
We use anaerobic and parasitic eukaryotes including Giardia Trichomonas and particularly Microsporidia as our models.  ,0
We are interested in the early evolution of eukaryotic cells their genomes and their organelles related to mitochondria (hydrogenosomes and mitosomes).  ,0

With regard to courses aimed at raising the skills and awareness of industrial and overseas researchers for 10 years I was co-organiser of the Cambridge “Advanced SEM Course” (organised by The Royal Microscopical Society) and also taught on the University of Surrey Modular MSc courses for “Engineering ceramics” “Scanning Electron Microscopy” and “Scanning Probe Microscopies”. ,0
In Newcastle I have taught a further 19 generations of engineering students in introductory materials science fracture and failure life-timing materials processing and selection microstructural design and tribology. ,0
 In Cambridge (until 1987) I taught several courses- including practical classes – in materials science metallurgy and crystallography to 19 generations of undergraduates in the Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy including supervising students taking materials engineering courses (materials’ microstructure properties and selection) in the University Engineering Department. ,0
 Teaching                    ,0
Though largely retired I continue to (more occasionally) publish – see selected publications list for new publications in 2015 & 2016.,0
From 1971 to 2008 I also supervised many research students and post-doctoral workers in both Universities. ,0
Examples include  new ways of using nanoindentation techniques to characterize the performance of coated systems Fresnel transmission electron microscopy methods for characterizing performance-limiting nanometer- thick grain boundary films cathodoluminescence and acoustic  imaging methods for detecting defects and impurities in ceramics using scanning electron  microscopy (SEM) and new scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques for exploring both surface topographies and friction and wear  responses.   ,0
One of my over-riding research themes has thus been to develop fundamental understandings of surface-contact-induced deformation mechanisms and their interaction with microstructure at the small scales at which responses are generated whileanother has been todevelop and translate the application of forefront scientific microscopy and property-measuring experimental methods to address critical issues in materials engineering (e.g. coatings wear parts gears electronic device materials) either by the extension and elaboration of the techniques themselves or by creating new approaches. ,0
This has focussed on developing the use of instrumented indentation tests (sometimes referred to as continuously-recording indentation techniques or nanoindentation) to create controlled levels of near-surface damage coupled with and high-resolution electron microscopy (HRSEM TEM HRTEM) and scanning probe microscopy (SPM) methods to reveal the surface and sub-surface nature of that damage.  ,0
A particular challenge has been to measure and hence understand and model those mechanical properties of surfaces which control mechanical responses component lifetimes and friction and wear - at the very small scales at which materials respond and the properties are controlled – thus making materials selection more dependent on scale-sensitive properties rather than bulk values. ,0
Research Interests During a 40 year research  career Trevor Page has published nearly 200 papers spanning research in materials science and engineering including the application of field-ion microscopy and electron and scanning probe microscopies to  problems and challenges in materials engineering the atomic structures of solid solutions the structure of property-controlling grain boundaries and interfaces in metals and ceramics the microstructural control of the properties of engineering ceramics ceramic coatings and composites surface engineering with thin hard coatings and ion implantation  the wear and tribology of ceramics sub-micron-scale indentation testing and the changing challenges of materials selection and design  with both new and existing materials.   ,1

Another theme has been to establish how ‘forefront microstructural techniques’ – emerging from time to time – e.g. HRTEM HRSEM AFM scanning electron acoustic microscopy and nanoindentation - can provide critical information for those using and applying materials.,0
This has often required the modification of techniques and the development of image contrast theories. ,0
In all cases emphasis has been placed on developing approaches to investigate the critical microstructural features governing properties engineering applications and lifetimes (e.g. grain boundary structures in metals and ceramics the adhesion and integrity of coatings) at the scales at which microstructural control occurs. ,0
These publications are a selection from the various research domains in which I have worked – all involving the elucidation of fundamental structure-property-process path relationships in metals ceramics ion-implanted and coated systems. ,0

Work started in SiDE on data analytics and sensors is now been driven forward through the National Innovation Centre for Ageing ,0
This drove much of our work on cloud computing as SiDE made heavy use of sensor-based systems which generate large amounts of data that must be analysed in order to understand human behaviour often in real-time. ,0
"""Paul directed the £12M Social Inclusion through the Digital Economy"""" (SiDE) project which aims to  realise the potential of digital technologies to transform the lives of those who are excluded. """,1
- Exploring how advanced technologies can improve the lives of those from vulnerable groups including older people disabled people and marginalised youth. ,0
Here's a paper on some of our work - it shows how this approach can dramatically extend the battery life of wearables.,0
We work on systems that start with a declarative description of the functional and non-functional requirements and work out how to map the computation across distributed infrastructure including healthcare monitors field gateways and clouds. ,0
Sensors are now generating vast quantities of data - extracting value from them requires new tools and techniques that combine statistics and computing to find and act on important patterns in the data. ,0

The legacy of this work continues in many of the e-Research applications we support on e-Science Central.,0
This led to the release of the widely adopted OGSA-DQP. ,0
From this and earlier work in parallel query processing we collaborated with Norman Paton's group at Manchester to explore how to integrate data held in distributed database servers exploiting grid computing to dynamically acquire computational resources as they are needed e.g. to speed-up queries through parallel joins. ,0
We worked on how to publish data through services (e.g. see the Databases and the Grid paper and Databases in Grid Applications: Distribution and Locality) so that it can be exploited in distributed applications. ,0
Interest in e-science is resulting in vast amounts of data being published. ,0
#NAME?,0
Our work on clouds builds on what we learnt in the Carmen project which designed and built a virtual laboratory to support neuroscientists.,0
Our work on using federated clouds to meet the security requirements of applications won the Best Paper award at IEEE CloudCom 2011. ,0
It is also our main research vehicle for cloud research in areas including provenance scalability formal methods and federated clouds. ,0
Since 2007 this has been focused on e-Science Central  a portable cloud platform for storing analysing and sharing data. e-Science Central is used to support a wide range of applications and users through the Digital Institute. ,0
This includes work on:- Cloud Computing. Methods for building scalable cloud-based applications are explored in a range of projects. ,0

I have recently demonstrated for the first time that tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy can lead to measurable signals from <50nm channel length devices based on strained Si/SiGe – this is the highest resolution non-destructive strain measurement technique for such materials.,0
To back this up I have been developing Raman spectroscopic methods for strain assessment at high spatial resolution. ,0
Such strain can be introduced by the growth of epitaxial silicon/germanium alloy regions and I have developed modelling approaches based on the finite element method for strain engineering in MOSFETs of less than 100nm in channel length. ,0
In the case of MOSFETs the generation of tensile or compressive strain in the channel can lead to increases in the mobility of electrons or holes and thus higher speed devices. ,0
I have used nanoindentation to provide data for constitutive equations for modelling devices such as MOSFETs and MEMS in order to design smaller devices with controlled levels of strain within them. ,0
In the last few years I have specialised in the mechanical response of functional materials such as coatings for microelectronic and optics applications. ,0
As coatings get thinner and deforming volumes get smaller it is essential to have this mix of modelling and experiment to understand results and generate valid design data for nano devices and this is a major focus of my ongoing research work.   ,0
At Newcastle I have established state-of-the-art nanoindentation facilities in a clean room environment through SRIF funding and taken the pioneering work of Professor Trevor Page in the nanoindentation area to new levels by combining indentation testing high resolution microscopy and advanced analytic and numerical modelling. ,1
My current research in Surface Engineering focuses on the mechanical response of coatings and surface treatments and in the last few years I have specialised in the assessment of the properties of very thin (<1micron thick coatings). ,0
Another focus has been on coatings and surface treatments to improve the contact fatigue resistance of gear steels which has led me to look at fundamental metallurgical investigations of the phase changes in case carburised steel due to contact stress (Martensite decay).   ,0
Much of my early work at Newcastle was aimed at solving problems with coatings for tooling and wear parts but I also started to work on coated glass with Pilkington plc who have become a long term supporter of my work. ,0
Since I am very keen to see that my work is useful to industry and can be directly applicable I have focussed it on materials produced at full scale by suppliers. ,0
This decision was driven by my observation that coatings produced under laboratory conditions were often considerably different from those produced in industrial units and the scale-up process was not straightforward or well understood. ,0
I took a conscious decision not to invest in coating plant of our own but to work closely with academics in other units and industry on state-of -the-art coating systems mostly for tribological applications. ,0
In the following six years I established a research group focussed on testing and designing with coatings. ,0
In the mid 1990s AEA Technology was privatised and I left for Newcastle University in 1996. ,0
It was in this period that I became involved in the International Conference on Metallurgical Coatings and Thin films (effectively the spring meeting of the American Vacuum Society) a link which continues to this day and has resulted in me being elected programme chair for the whole conference for the 2010 meeting and General Chair for the 2011 Meeting.   ,1
The work involved developing new coating technologies (e.g. ion beam assisted deposition) new coating materials and architectures (e.g. plasma sprayed yttria coatings for resistance to molten metals) improving coating test methods (e.g. controlled scratch testing for adhesion assessment) and assessing coating performance in order to determine design rules and suitability in a range of applications (e.g. tools gas turbine blades automotive exhaust pipes and optical fibre furnaces). ,0
In the eight years I worked for the organisation (1988-1996) I rose to be the head of the coatings and interfaces section conducting research on all coatings technologies joining methods and high temperature oxidation. ,1
Research I started my research career doing contract research at AEA Technology Harwell. ,0

Chemical engineering problems were introduced into the course once the students knowledge and skill has reached the appropriate level. ,0
This allowed increased flexibility with the opportunity for students to pace themselves. ,0
The course included online tests (typically two per week) to monitor student progression through the material. ,0
It is generally accepted to be very difficult to teach programming to students using traditional teaching techniques (e.g. lectures) and consequently when teaching programming at UMIST I developed web-based material for the delivery of the ‘IT and Applications’ course. ,0
The course is complemented with a text book on the subject authored by myself as well as web material summarising what is covered in the lectures.,0
Excellent results on teaching evaluation questionnaires have been consistently obtained. ,0
While the students work on the examples the opportunity is taken to talk with them to find and correct misunderstandings as they occur. ,0
The examples are simple but designed to test understanding and should be completed by average students within twenty minutes. ,0
Generally each lecture consists of a twenty minute introduction to a concept followed by an example for the students to try. ,0
Recognition of this came through an Imperial College Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1996.During my time teaching Chemical Reaction Engineering (Imperial College) and Kinetics and Catalysis (Edinburgh) I gradually modified my approach to include a strong interactive element in the lectures (this course in now delivered in Newcastle as Reactor Engineering). ,0
I have been an innovator in chemical engineering education since my appointment in 1987 as a lecturer at Imperial College. ,1

Teaching                    ,0
My research involves the application of both solid electrolytes and mixed-conducting membrane systems for reaction and separation. ,0
If the electronic conductivity is high the material can be used as a mixed-conducting membrane. ,0
In many cases solid oxide materials can exhibit very high ionic conductivities (e.g. oxygen-ion or proton conductivity). If at the same time the electronic conductivity of the material is very low the material can be employed as a solid electrolyte. ,0
Much of my research involves working with inorganic membranes. ,0
I have published more than 100 refereed papers supervised around 40 PhD students.,0
While the emphasis is very much on applied research often a fundamental understanding of the nature of the problem is necessary. ,0
The focus of my research is in applying chemical engineering to problems in the area of catalysis and high temperature membranes. ,0
This has been achieved through a balanced combination of individual and collaborative grants and contracts. ,0
Over the past twenty-five years I have built-up an externally funded research programme with a strong equipment base. ,0

Undergraduate Teaching,0
Teaching                    ,0
I lead the Drives theme within the UK Underpinning Power Electronics Initiative. ,0
We receive funding from a range of sources including EPSRC who have awarded two platform grants TSB and EU and a huge range of industrial companies. ,0
Funding,0
I am a member of the Rolls Royce Electrical Control Systems and Electronics Advisory Board.,1
I have also been MSc course external examiner at Manchester University and Nottingham University.,0
I have been external examiner of PhDs throughout the UK and Europe.,0
I have been undergraduate course external examiner at the Loughborough University the Robert Gordon Institute  and Nottingham University. ,0
I hold a number of patents in the field of electrical machines.,0
Paper prizes awarded from the IEE and IEEE for reluctance motor and fault tolerant research.,0
Esteem Indicators,0
However the development and introduction of new technology is equally essential in all cases.,0
Challenges range from cost driven elements in consumer products through to reliability issues in aerospace and automotive drives with increased efficiency becoming an increasingly important aspect.  ,0
Current research ranges from entirely blue sky work funded by EPSRC in which we are researching speculative low cost electrical drives and machines though to exciting applied research in which we are working closely with industry to produce new novel electrical systems.  ,0
Current Work,0
Potential PhD Research Projects Novel switched and synchronous machines High performance permanent magnet machines Novel drive topologies Fault tolerant drives Aerospace actuation systems Electric vehicle traction motors The School website has more information on research degrees and funding. ,0
I also have PhD students funded by Protean Electric a manufacturer of direct drive in-wheel motors for high performance vehicles and also sit on their technical advisory board.,1
The Dyson Research Centre has a combination of Dyson staff and Dyson funded PhD students researching both magnetics and power electronics. ,0
Most of this work is conducted in collaboration with Aerospace companies including UTAS BAE Systems and Airbus.,0
A large proportion of my research is in collaboration with industry. For example I coordinate a large Dyson presence within our school.  ,0
In this work we are increasing system reliability through redundancy and fault tolerance within the electrical machine and power electronic converter. ,0
I have led much of the novel work on fault tolerant electrical machines and drives for safety critical systems.  ,0
I have a particular interest in novel forms of switched reluctance machine and have pioneered work on SRMs with fully pitched windings and SRMs with segmental rotors.,0
My main research interests lie in novel electrical machines power electronic controllers and electromagnetics.  ,0
